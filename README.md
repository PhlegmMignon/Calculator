# Calculator
Objective is to create a working calculator to practice js, css, and html

Reflection:
Getting obsessed with fixing edge cases wasn't very productive for my learning. 
As the js file got longer, the code became harder to understand after being away for a couple days.
In the future, I should try to use more variables instead of reusing old ones so they become easier to track. Also I should look more into how I should be organizing my code (splitting into many small functions and what order should the functions appear in code).

Something to work on in the future is to study color theory more as the color palettes I explored
didn't seem to mesh very well.
